<p>The iPhone 5 is a smartphone designed and marketed by Apple Inc. It is the sixth generation of
    the iPhone, succeeding the iPhone 4S and preceding the iPhone 5S and iPhone 5C. Formally unveiled
    as part of a press event on September 12, 2012, it was released on September 21, 2012.[12] The iPhone
    5 is the first iPhone to be announced in September and setting a trend for subsequent iPhone releases,
    the first iPhone to be completely developed under the guidance of Tim Cook and the last iPhone to be
    overseen by Steve Jobs.</p>

<p>The iPhone 5 featured major design changes in comparison to its predecessor. These included an
    aluminum-based body which was thinner and lighter than previous models, a taller screen with a nearly
    16:9 aspect ratio, the Apple A6 system-on-chip, LTE support, and Lightning, a new compact dock connector
    which replaced the 30-pin design used by previous iPhone models. This was the second Apple phone to include
    its new Sony-made 8 MP camera, which was first introduced on the iPhone 4S.</p>

<p>Apple began taking pre-orders on September 14, 2012,[2] and over two million were received within 24
    hours.[6] Initial demand for the iPhone 5 exceeded the supply available at launch on September 21, 2012,
    and was described by Apple as "extraordinary", with pre-orders having sold twenty times faster than its
    predecessors. While reception to the iPhone 5 was generally positive, consumers and reviewers noted
    hardware issues, such as an unintended purple hue in photos taken, and the phone's coating being prone
    to chipping. Reception was also mixed over Apple's decision to switch to a different dock connector
    design, as the change affected iPhone 5's compatibility with accessories that were otherwise compatible
    with previous iterations of the line.</p>

<p>The iPhone 5 was officially discontinued by Apple on September 10, 2013 with the announcement of its
    successors, the iPhone 5S and the iPhone 5C.[13] The iPhone 5 has the shortest lifespan of any iPhone ever
    produced with only twelve months in production, breaking with Apple's standard practice of selling an
    existing iPhone model at a reduced price upon the release of a new model, being replaced as a midrange
    and then an entry-level device by the iPhone 5C; the 5C internal hardware specifications are almost
    identical to the 5 albeit having a less expensive polycarbonate exterior. The iPhone 5 supports 6, 7, 8,
    9, and 10, but not iOS 11 which was released on September 19, 2017. The iPhone 5 is the second iPhone
    to support five major versions of iOS after the iPhone 4S.</p>
